## Prefacing piece
_Basically just a record and a distillation of stuff from_ [here](learnopengl.com). _Also OpenGL is mostly obsolete now and so this is largely educational, for me._

This also means this is based on GLFW and GLAD libraries.

## Drawing

_This section corresponds to_ [this page](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)

OpenGL is a 3D graphics library so all coordinates used are correspondingly in 3D (x, y, z coordinates). Also, OpenGL uses normalized device graphics, meaning the only coordinates drawn are between -1.0 and 1.0. So we can have a set of vertex data like this:

```c++
float vertices[] = {
    -0.5f, -0.5f, 0f,
    0.5f, -0.5f, 0f,
    0f, 0.5f, 0f
};
```

This needs to be sent to be stored in the GPU memory, which we do so using __vertex buffer objects__ (VBO) to allow sending as much vertex data at once as possible (sending stuff to GPU memory is slow).

```c++
unsigned int VBO;           // the ID for the buffer
glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);      // create the buffer assigned to that ID

// bind the buffer to be used to the appropriate target GL_ARRAY_BUFFER
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);

// copy vertex data onto the buffer's memory
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
```

It should be noted that multiple buffers can be bound at once, only if they are of different types, which in this case is a `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER`.  
`glBufferData` is a function used to copy user-defined data to the bound buffers, so the first argument is used to specify which buffer to copy to. The second and third arguments are related to the data we want to send.  
The fourth argument has 3 forms:

* `GL_STATIC_DRAW`: the data doesn't change and used many times by the GPU
* `GL_STREAM_DRAW`: the data doesn't change and used a few times at most
* `GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW`: the data is set often and used many times

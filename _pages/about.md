I'm a computer science student from Thailand. This blog is mainly to document the things I learn and the currently few
things I know about computing.

Lately, my focus has been mostly on computer vision and graphics, which means my latest interest has been on neural rendering techniques.
In fact, I have been fortunate enough to be working as a research assistant at Georgia Tech since January 2022 on generative image models
based on GLIDE diffusion models.

I'm also contributing to the Godot game engine, now approaching version 4.0.
It's best to get to know the inner workings of an open-source project with such potential before it gets too big to explore after all.

Python and C++ are my main programming languages but I also do well Java, Go, Javascript and a pinch of HTML.
Frameworks and tools I use frequently include: Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy, CMake, Docker and React.

This blog will be (hopefully) kept updated with the different things I go through as I learn more about programming and
the other things that will come along as well. Hopefully, not only will it serve as somewhere for me to keep notes on
the things I do but also (maybe) as a guide for anyone who does come across to reading it.

I'm a (former) computer science student from Thailand. This blog is mainly to document my knowledge and other things I learn.

I specialize in computer graphics. Check out my OpenGL rendering engine [here](https://github.com/keptsecret/CivetRender)!
I also worked on a [game](https://github.com/kevinsadi/lei3d/) built on our custom game engine (also worked on the render pipeline for that).
Going after learning Vulkan next.

Python and C++ are my main programming languages but I also do Java and a pinch of Javascript.
Frameworks and tools I use frequently include: OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, CMake, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy.

This blog will be (hopefully) kept updated with the different things I go through as I learn more about programming and
the other things that will come along as well. Hopefully, not only will it serve as somewhere for me to keep notes on
the things I do but also (maybe) as a guide for anyone who does come across to reading it.

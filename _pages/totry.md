* __[Angular.js](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/angular-6-mean-stack-crash-course-part-1-front-end-project-setup-and-routing-89bec8332cea)__ - complete the MEAN stack I've been looking at
* __[OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)__ - brush up my C++ knowledge and learn about graphics
* __Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow)__ - about halfway through

## Might Check Out

* __OpenCV__ - going through it some more
* __Blender dev__ - I know C++ but this is mostly written in C, so pointers and all that jazz
* __[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)__ - backend framework in Python

_Basically, I've no idea which part of software development I would like best so I'mma try them all._

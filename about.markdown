I'm a computer science student from Thailand. This blog is mainly to document the things I learn and the currently few 
things I know about programming.

I'll probably be working through things like computer vision (so OpenCV), machine learning (gotta decide between TF and
 PyTorch at some point) but also the miscellaneous programming projects I probably should start on.  
Python, Java and C++ are mostly my tools but I can work with HTMl (_shudder_) and various Javascript languages as well.
